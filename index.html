Working at a startup has provided me with an extensive range of opportunity; allowing me to work mainly as a QA Engineer and a plethora of other positions. While I am quality assurance testing before each release I am also a main test automation engineer using Cucumber and Capybara to create automated tests with Jenkins as the continuous integration tool. Working within the agile team, I have combined both white box and black box testing techniques. Lastly I have performed system, unit, performance, load, regression, stress, API, and data interface testing. This in turned helped me provide client developer teams with detailed reports on quality metrics, identified many bugs/flaws and recommended fixes.</more>

                                <more>My first internship I implemented Java tiered web applications using an Agile/Iterative approach. I also wrote a handful of JUnit test cases, helped manage and manipulate the database, and fixed a series of code defects. At Delta Dental, we followed the Agile software development methodology, utilized test-driven development, pair programmed, and I was involved in a cross team collaboration on a new development project. The web application I developed within was a tiered application using JSP, Delegates, DAO, Assembler, DTO, all the way through to the entity. One more thing I accomplished was streamlining the setup process for a new developer coming into the office with a step-by-step guide to getting one's environment set-up on a new machine.</more>
