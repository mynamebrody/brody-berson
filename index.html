                        <p>Recent transplant to Boulder, CO from the Midwest. I've done a little bit everything while going through school from application development to technical support to user experience studies and now becoming a quality assurance engineer and ScrumMaster. It truly has been an amazing experience building my professional history through my years attending Grand Valley State University and beyond. I am always looking for what lies ahead in user experience, web design, and quality assurance by being deeply involved in exploring new technologies and really discovering what is the next big thing. My freelancing web design firm (AKA "My Portfolio") can be found at: <a href="http://www.sleepingbeardesign.com/" target="_blank">Sleeping Bear Design</a> and all of my thoughts can be found on my blog on <a href="https://medium.com/@brody_berson" target="_blank">Medium</a>.</p>

I user test each site with a group of individuals to get their hands on it and watch their experience of how they interact and navigate the site.</p>

		                                <p>I provided the first line of application support to users and clients of Yello (formerly RECSOLU). I helped support system availability of our web and mobile applications in production and staging environments, work independently with customers during implementation and in production to provide dedicated and exceptional service, including troubleshooting at a technical level. Working at a startup has provided me with an extensive range of opportunity; allowing me to work mainly as a QA Engineer and a plethora of other positions. While I am quality assurance testing before each release I am also a main test automation engineer using Cucumber and Capybara to create automated tests with Jenkins as the continuous integration tool. Working within the agile team, I have combined both white box and black box testing techniques. Lastly I have performed system, unit, performance, load, regression, stress, API, and data interface testing. This in turned helped me provide client developer teams with detailed reports on quality metrics, identified many bugs/flaws and recommended fixes.</p>

I had the opportunity to work closely with the web developers to collaborate on the redesign of <a href="http://warriordash.com/">WarriorDash.com</a> to create a responsive design that is clean and friendly. Also I supported Dell Servers, Watchguard services, over 200 Apple devices and 100 Windows machines. Lastly, one of my favorite things about the internship was that I helped create a <a href="http://wordpress.org/">Wordpress</a> based website to be used everyday internally as a “Knowledge Base” where departments can store important FAQs and “How- Tos” to increase productivity and store them all in one place.</p>

		                                <p>My first internship I implemented Java tiered web applications using an Agile/Iterative approach. I also wrote a handful of JUnit test cases, helped manage and manipulate the database, and fixed a series of code defects. At Delta Dental, we followed the Agile software development methodology, utilized test-driven development, pair programmed, and I was involved in a cross team collaboration on a new development project. The web application I developed within was a tiered application using JSP, Delegates, DAO, Assembler, DTO, all the way through to the entity. One more thing I accomplished was streamlining the setup process for a new developer coming into the office with a step-by-step guide to getting one's environment set-up on a new machine.</p>
